In my one month internship I will be submitting per day log.


| Day Number  |  Planned Work | Delivered| Ticket |
|---|---|---|---|
| Day 1  | Add OS and System Info  | [PR](https://github.com/alice-sieve/Linux-Kernel/pull/25)  | [Issue](https://github.com/alice-sieve/Linux-Kernel/issues/7)  |
| Day 2| Write List of Kernel APIs | [PR](https://github.com/alice-sieve/Linux-Kernel/pull/28) | [Issue](https://github.com/alice-sieve/Linux-Kernel/issues/6) |

## Things that made me stuck
Understanding how APIs need to be listed and order in which instances of APIs need to find using grep.
Issue resolved and got fair idea of flow required to proceed ahead - [Explanation](https://github.com/alice-sieve/Linux-Kernel/issues/29).
